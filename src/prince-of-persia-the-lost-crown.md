Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is a new kind of Prince of Persia game. Instead of running and jumping like in the old ones, this one is more like a puzzle game with fighting. You play as a super strong guy who can slow down time to solve tricky puzzles and beat bad guys. It's like a mix of old school Prince of Persia and a thinking game.

## ★★★★★
The old series beautifully remade more modern.
