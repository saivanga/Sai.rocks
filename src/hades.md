You play as Zagreus, a god trying to escape the Underworld where his dad, Hades, lives. It's like a really cool adventure with lots of fighting and magic. You get to meet cool gods like Zeus and Athena who help you on your journey.

Everytime you start a new run the world is different from before, maybe more loot, money, or mini bosses. and each time you are not to get the god you want everytime so I think that it makes it just that much more replayable.

## ★★★★★
Good game and story.
